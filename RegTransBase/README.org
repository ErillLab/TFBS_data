* RegTransBase

[[regtransbase.lbl.gov][RegTransBase]] ([[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/14/213][Cipriano et al.]]) is a database of regulatory sequences and
interactions in bacterial genomes. It consists of two modules:
- database of regulatory interactions
- manually curated database of transcription factor binding sites.

Two modules, the database and the alignment of transcription factor binding
sites are available on RegTransBase website, as MySQL dump and a collection of
fasta files, respectively. 

* Getting and cleaning RegTransBase data

** Exporting MySQL dump and TFBS alignments as CSV files

** Getting experimentally verified sites
