* Transcription Factor Binding Site Data

Collection of Python scripts for getting and cleaning transcription factor
binding site data from a collection of gene regulation databases.

This repository contains data from following databases.

- [[collectf.umbc.edu][CollecTF]] (prokaryotic-wide)
- [[http://mtbreglist.genap.ca/MtbRegList/www/index.php][MtbRegList]] (/Mycobacterium tuberculosis/)
- [[regtransbase.lbl.gov][RegTransBase]] (prokaryotic-wide)
- [[regulondb.ccg.unam.mx][RegulonDB]] (/Escherichia coli/) - TODO
- [[http://dbtbs.hgc.jp/][DBTBS]] (/Bacillus subtilis/) - TODO
- [[coryneregnet.de][CoryneRegNet]] (/Corynebacterium/ species) - TODO

In addition to database-specific csv/tsv files, the data is merged into one tsv
file having following fields

|-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| column                  | description                                         |
|-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| genome_accession        | NCBI RefSeq genome accession number                 |
| TF                      | transcription factor                                |
| TF_accession            | transcription factor accession number               |
| site_start              | site start position (0-indexed, inclusive)          |
| site_end                | site end position (0-indexed, exclusive)            |
| site_strand             | site strand, {+, -}                                 |
| left_flanking           | left flanking region of the site (100bp)            |
| site_sequence           | site sequence [ACTG]+                               |
| right_flanking          | right flanking region of the site (100bp)           |
| regulated_operon        | the regulated genes/operon (as originally reported) |
| mode                    | TF mode {activator, repressor, dual, undefined}     |
| evidence                | list of techniques or PMIDs                         |
| database                | the source of the site                              |
| alternative_database_id | original id used in the source database             |
|-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|

The site location is 0 indexed. Start index is inclusive and end index is
exclusive. For each record,

#+begin_src python
if site_strand == +1:
  site_sequence = genome_sequence[start:end]
else:
  site_sequence = reverse_complement(genome_sequence[start:end])
#+end_src

Left and right flanking regions are 100 bp sequences on both ends of the
site. When they are concatenated with the site (i.e =left_flanking +
site_sequence + right_flanking=), joined sequence should be present in either
strand of the genome.

** Concatenated data


The csv files (one from each database) are concatenated into
=tfbs_data_merged.tsv= (see =to_my_format.py=). The RegTransBase is not included
in the merged file as most of its sites don't have any associated experimental
evidence (see =regtransbase= readme file).
