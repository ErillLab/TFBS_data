* Transcription Factor Binding Site Data

Collection of Python scripts for getting and cleaning transcription factor
binding site data from a collection of gene regulation databases.

This repository contains data from following databases.

- [[collectf.umbc.edu][CollecTF]] (prokaryotic-wide)
- [[http://mtbreglist.genap.ca/MtbRegList/www/index.php][MtbRegList]] (/Mycobacterium tuberculosis/)
- [[regtransbase.lbl.gov][RegTransBase]] (prokaryotic-wide)
- [[regulondb.ccg.unam.mx][RegulonDB]] (/Escherichia coli/) - TODO
- [[http://dbtbs.hgc.jp/][DBTBS]] (/Bacillus subtilis/) - TODO
- [[coryneregnet.de][CoryneRegNet]] (/Corynebacterium/ species) - TODO

In addition to database-specific csv/tsv files, the data is merged into one tsv
file having following fields

|---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =genome_accession=        | NCBI RefSeq genome accession number                 |
| =TF=                      | transcription factor                                |
| =TF_accession=            | transcription factor accession number               |
| =site_start=              | site start position (0-indexed, inclusive)          |
| =site_end=                | site end position (0-indexed, exclusive)            |
| =site_strand=             | site strand, {+, -}                                 |
| =left_flanking=           | left flanking region of the site (100bp)            |
| =site_sequence=           | site sequence [ACTG]+                               |
| =right_flanking=          | right flanking region of the site (100bp)           |
| =regulated_operon=        | the regulated genes/operon (as originally reported) |
| =mode=                    | TF mode {activator, repressor, dual, undefined}     |
| =evidence=                | list of techniques or PMIDs                         |
| =database=                | the source of the site                              |
| =alternative_database_id= | original id used in the source database             |
|---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|

The csv files (one from each database) is merged into =tfbs_data_merged.tsv=
(see =to_my_format.py=). The RegTransBase is not included in the merged file as
most of its sites don't have any associated experimental evidence (see
=regtransbase= readme file).
