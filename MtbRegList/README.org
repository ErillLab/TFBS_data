* MtbRegList

MtbRegList is a database containing gene expression and regulation data in
/M. tuberculosis/. The python script in this repository reads the tab-delimited
text file exported from MtbRegList, filters transcription factor binding site
records and reconstructs the binding sites using /M. tuberculosis/ H37Rv genome
and given binding site location relative to its flanking genes. The script
generates a comma-separated file containing
- genome accession number
- TF locus tag
- TF name synonyms
- site start position
- site end position
- site strand
- site sequence
